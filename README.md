## Features

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the buttons on the calculator interface to enter numbers and perform operations.
4. The active screen shows the current input, while the inactive screen displays the evaluated result.

## Customize
You can customize the calculator by modifying the `style.css` file. The CSS variables at the top of the file allow you to change the colors, font size, and other visual aspects of the calculator interface.

```css
:root {
  --text-color: white;
  --text-color-inactive: rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, .);
  --backgroundcolor: black;
  --neutral: rgb(5%, 5%, 5%);
  --text-size: 2rem;
  --primarycolor: dodgerblue;
}

Feel free to experiment with these variables to create your desired visual theme.
